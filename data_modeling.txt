Objective: Design a database with at least 4 tables for a pet adoption agency
that I am opening where animals will be rescued and cared for.  Will also need
to keep track of good matches for potential owners that will adopt.

Brainstorming:
> Owner's name, phone number, email
> Owner's lifestyle (active or sedentary), family living in the home, previous 
experience with pets, living quarters (house or apartment)
> What owner is looking for in a pet: size, pet type, breed, disability, age,
previous training (prefers a trained pet?)
> Pet's name, age, type, breed, size, notes on training, notes on disabilities,
other notes on temperament, etc.

Table Ideas:

Owner_info:
	- Name
	- Phone number
	- Email
About_owner:
	- Lifestyle
	- Household_members
	- Previous_experience
	- Home_type
Household_members:
	- Age
	- Sex/Gender
Desired_pet:
	- Size
	- Age
	- Type
	- Breed
	- Disabilities
	- Training_completed
Pet:
	- Name
	- Age
	- Size
	- Type
	- Breed
	- Training_notes
	- Disability_notes
	- Temperament_notes
	- Other_notes
Adopted:
	- Owner_id
	- Pet_id

One to One:
	- Tables and table id's (PRIMARY KEY's)
	- Owner_info => About_owner
	- Pet => Adopted (A single pet can be adopted by a single owner)
One to Many:
	- Owner_info => Desired_pet (A single owner may desire to adopt more
	  than one pet)
	- Owner_info => Adopted (Owner may adopt more than one pet)
	- About_owner => Household_members (May have multiple people living with
	  potential owner)
Many to Many:
	- Desired_pet => Pet (Can have multiple matches for pets and what owners
	  want if initial matches are primarily based on Type, Breed, etc but
	  may still be ruled out later on due to other factors such as
	  lifestyle)

List of Tables:

CREATE TABLE owner_info(
  owner_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_name VARCHAR(50),
  owner_phone VARCHAR(10),
  owner_email VARCHAR(50)
);

);

CREATE TABLE household_members(
  member_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES about_owner(household_members_id),
